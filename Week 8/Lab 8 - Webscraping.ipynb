It also established a mechanism by which an intra-term vacancy in the vice presidency could be filled. Richard Nixon was the first president to fill a vacancy under this provision when he <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/United_States_vice_presidential_selection,_1973\" title=\"United States vice presidential selection, 1973\">selected</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Gerald_Ford\" title=\"Gerald Ford\">Gerald Ford</a> for the office following <a href=\"/wiki/Spiro_Agnew\" title=\"Spiro Agnew\">Spiro Agnew</a>'s resignation in 1973. The following year, Ford became the second to do so when he <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/United_States_vice_presidential_selection,_1974\" title=\"United States vice presidential selection, 1974\">chose</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Nelson_Rockefeller\" title=\"Nelson Rockefeller\">Nelson Rockefeller</a> to succeed him after he acceded to the presidency. As no mechanism existed for filling an intra-term vacancy in the vice presidency prior to 1967, the office was left vacant until filled through the next ensuing presidential election.\n",

The Constitution is silent on the issue of political parties, and at the time it came into force in 1789, there were no parties. Soon after the <a href=\"/wiki/1st_United_States_Congress\" title=\"1st United States Congress\">1st Congress</a> convened, factions began rallying around dominant <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Washington_administration\" title=\"Washington administration\">Washington administration</a> officials, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton\" title=\"Alexander Hamilton\">Alexander Hamilton</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson\" title=\"Thomas Jefferson\">Thomas Jefferson</a>. Greatly concerned about the capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never affiliated with a political party.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-GWpps_2-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-GWpps-2\">[2]</a></sup>\n",

For example, George Washington served two consecutive terms and is counted as the first president (not the first and second). Upon the resignation of 37th president Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford became the 38th president even though he simply served out the remainder of Nixon's second term and was never elected to the presidency in his own right. Grover Cleveland was both the 22nd president and the 24th president because his two terms were not consecutive. A vice president who temporarily becomes acting president under the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution is not counted, because the president remains in office during such a period.</span>\n",
